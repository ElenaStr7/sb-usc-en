            <p class="card-text">Doppler ultrasound tests are used to help health care providers find out if you have a condition that is reducing or blocking your blood flow. It may also be used to help diagnose certain heart diseases. The test is most often used to:
      
              Check heart function. It is often done along with an electrocardiogram, a test that measures electrical signals in the heart.
              Look for blockages in blood flow. Blocked blood flow in the legs can cause a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

              Check for blood vessel damage and for defects in the structure of the heart.
              Look for narrowing of blood vessels. Narrowed arteries in arms and legs can mean you have condition called peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Narrowing of arteries in the neck can mean you have a condition called carotid artery stenosis.
              Monitor blood flow after surgery.
              Check for normal blood flow in a pregnant woman and her unborn baby.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">What happens during a Doppler ultrasound? </h5>
            <p class="card-text">A Doppler ultrasound usually includes the following steps:
      
              You will lie a table, exposing the area of your body that's being tested.
              A health care provider will spread a special gel on the skin over that area.
              The provider will move a wand-like device, called a transducer, over the area.
              The device sends sound waves into your body.
              The movement of blood cells causes a change in the pitch of the sound waves. You may hear swishing or pulse-like sounds during the procedure.
              The waves are recorded and turned into images or graphs on a monitor.
              After the test is over, the provider will wipe the gel off your body.
              The test takes about 15-25 minutes to complete.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?  </h5>
          <p class="card-text">To prepare for a Doppler ultrasound, you may need to:
      
            Remove clothing and jewellry from the area of the body that is getting tested.
            Avoid cigarettes and other products that have nicotine for up to two hours before your test. Nicotine causes blood vessels to narrow, which can affect your results.
            For certain types of Doppler tests, you may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.
        
            Your health care provider will let you know if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.</p>

          <p class="card-text">
              Diagnostic ultrasound is a safe procedure that uses low-power sound waves. There are no known risks.
              Although ultrasound is a valuable tool, it has limitations. Sound doesn't travel well through air or bone, so ultrasound isn't effective at imaging parts of your body that have gas in them or are hidden by bone. To view these areas, your doctor may order other imaging tests, such as CT or MRI scans or X-rays.
